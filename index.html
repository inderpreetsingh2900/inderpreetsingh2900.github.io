            <h2>My sql Tutorials</h2>



            <p>MySQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of MySQL. Our MySQL tutorial is designed for
                beginners and professionals. MySQL is a relational database management system based on the Structured
                Query Language, which is the popular language for accessing and managing the records in the database.
                MySQL is open-source and free software under the GNU license.</p>

            <p>Our MySQL tutorial includes all topics of MySQL database that provides for how to manage database and to
                manipulate data with the help of various SQL queries. These queries are: insert records, update records,
                delete records, select records, create tables, drop tables, etc. There are also given MySQL interview
                questions to help you better understand the MySQL database.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">What is Database?</h2>
            <p>It is very important to understand the database before learning MySQL. A database is an application that
                stores the organized collection of records. It can be accessed and manage by the user very easily. It
                allows us to organize data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the relevant information very
                quickly. Each database contains distinct API for performing database operations such as creating,
                managing, accessing, and searching the data it stores. Today, many databases available like MySQL,
                Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. In this section, we are going to focus on MySQL
                mainly.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">What is MySQL?</h2><br>
            <li>It allows us to implement database operations on tables, rows, columns, and indexes.</li>
            <h2 class="heading">How MySQL Works?</h2>
            <p>MySQL follows the working of Client-Server Architecture. This model is designed for the end-users called
                clients to access the resources from a central computer known as a server using network services. Here,
                the clients make requests through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the server will give the desired
                output as soon as the instructions are matched. The process of MySQL environment is the same as the
                client-server model.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The core of the MySQL database is the MySQL Server. This server is available as a separate program and
                responsible for handling all the database instructions, statements, or commands. The working of MySQL
                database with MySQL Server are as follows:</p>
            <ol class="points">
                <li>MySQL creates a database that allows you to build many tables to store and manipulate data and
                    defining the relationship between each table.</li>
                <br><br>
                <h1 style="margin-left: 3.5%; font-size: 22px;">MySQL Data Types</h1>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>A Data Type specifies a particular type of data, like integer, floating points, Boolean, etc. It also
                    identifies the possible values for that type, the operations that can be performed on that type, and
                    the way the values of that type are stored. In MySQL, each database table has many columns and
                    contains specific data types for each column.</p>
                <p>We can determine the data type in MySQL with the following characteristics:</p>
                <br>
                <p class="dt"><b>Data Types</b> <br>
                    TINYINT<br>
                    SMALLINT<br>
                    MEDIUMINT<br>
                    INT<br>
                    BIGINT<br>
                    FLOAT(m,d)<br>
                    DOUBLE(m,d)<br>
                    DECIMAL(m,d)<br>
                    BIT(m)<br>
                    BOOL<br>
                    BOOLEAN<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>String Data Types:</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>The string data type is used to hold plain text and binary data, for example, files, images, etc.
                    MySQL can perform searching and comparison of string value based on the pattern matching such as
                    LIKE operator, Regular Expressions, etc.</p>
                <p>The following table illustrates all string data types that support in MySQL:</p>
                <br>
                <center>
                    <table class="alt">

                        </tr>
                        <tr></tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>CHAR(size)</td>
                            <td>It can have a maximum size of 255 characters.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>VARCHAR(size)</td>
                            <td>It can have a maximum size of 255 characters.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>It can have a maximum size of 255 characters.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>TEXT(size)</td>
                            <td>Maximum size of 65,535 characters.</td>
                        </tr>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                <h1 class="h1">MySQL Variables</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Variables are used for storing data or information during the execution of a program. It is a way of
                    labeling data with an appropriate name that helps to understand the program more clearly by the
                    reader. The main purpose of the variable is to store data in memory and can be used throughout the
                    program.</p>
                <br>
                <p>MySQL can use variables in <strong>three</strong> different ways, which are given below:</p>
                <ol class="points">
                    <li> User-Defined Variable</li>
                    <li>Local Variable</li>
                    <li>System Variable</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h2 class="h3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-Defined Variable</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, we want to pass values from one statement to another statement. The user-defined variable
                    enables us to store a value in one statement and later can refer it to another statement.MySQL
                    provides a <strong>SET</strong> and <strong>SELECT</strong> statement to declare and initialize a
                    variable. The user-defined variable name starts with <strong>@ symbol</strong>.</p>
                <p>The user-defined variables are not case-sensitive such as @name and @NAME; both are the same. A
                    user-defined variable declares by one person cannot visible to another person. We can assign the
                    user-defined variable into limited data types like integer, float, decimal, string, or NULL. The
                    user-defined variable can be a maximum of <strong>64 characters</strong> in length.</p>

                <br>
                <h3 class="h4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax</h3>
                <p>The following syntax is used to declare a user-defined variable.</p>
                <p>1. By using the <strong>SET</strong> statement</p>
                <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="sql">
            SET @var_name = value;
            </textarea></div>
                <h4 class="n">NOTE: We can use either '=' or ':=' assignment operator with the SET statement.</h4>
                <p>2. By using the <strong>SELECT</strong> statement</p>
                <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="sql">
            SELECT @var_name := value;
            </textarea></div>
                <h3 class="h4">Example1</h3>
                <p>Here, we are going to assign a value to a variable by using the SET statement.</p>
                <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="sql">
            mysql&gt; SET @name='peter';
            </textarea></div>
                <p>Then, we can display the above value by using the SELECT statement.</p>
                <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="sql">
            mysql&gt; SELECT @name;
            </textarea></div>
                <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
